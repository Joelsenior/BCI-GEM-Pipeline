function varargout = context_pipeline_settings(varargin)
% CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS MATLAB code for context_pipeline_settings.fig
%      CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS, by itself, creates a new CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS returns the handle to a new CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS('Property','Value',...) creates a new CONTEXT_PIPELINE_SETTINGS or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before context_pipeline_settings_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to context_pipeline_settings_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
